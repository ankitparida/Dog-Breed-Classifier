## Project Overview

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)! A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data. Here, we will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images.

![Sample Output][image1]

 The major objective is to understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.Â 
The goal is to classify images of dogs according to their breed. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine's breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## Project Workflow

Step 0: Import Datasets

Step 1: Detect Humans

Step 2: Detect Dogs

Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)

Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

Step 6: Write your Algorithm

Step 7: Test Your Algorithm
